## About 

This is the backend for my priorisation project. My second attempt at doing a front and backend application using
vue and laravel which keeps the two separate. This time I'm learning from my mistakes and keeping it simpler. 
Minimising the packages and just using laravel and Vue Cli for now. 

For more detail you'll probably find it in my Vue CLI project
